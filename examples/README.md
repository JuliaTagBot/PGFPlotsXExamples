## Examples

* The notebooks named like chapters are examples taken from the PGFPlots manual that can be found at http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/pgfplots_unstable.pdf. Contributions with more examples are very welcome.
* The notebook `PGFPlots.jl.ipynb` replicates a majority of the plots in the [PGFPlots.jl](https://github.com/sisl/PGFPlots.jl) package.
* The notebook `custom_types.ipynb` shows a few of the optional capabilities, available when the corresponding package is loaded.
